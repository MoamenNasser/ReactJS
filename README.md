# ReactJS Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains my React learning revision and small projects as I work through various JavaScript and React concepts.

## About This Repository

This is my personal learning space where I practice and experiment with React and JavaScript concepts. The repository serves as:
- A revision hub for React fundamentals
- A collection of small projects and exercises
- A place to document my learning progress
- Practice ground for modern JavaScript and React patterns

## Current Projects

### 📁 MODAL_Window_Game
A JavaScript modal window implementation featuring:
- **Interactive modal windows** - Three buttons that trigger modal displays
- **DOM manipulation** - Practice with event listeners and class toggling
- **CSS styling** - Modern modal design with overlay effects

**Technologies used:**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- DOM manipulation techniques

Through this repository, I'm focusing on:
- ✅ JavaScript fundamentals and ES6+ features
- ✅ DOM manipulation and event handling
- 🔄 React component architecture (upcoming)
- 🔄 State management and hooks (upcoming)
- 🔄 Modern development workflow (upcoming)
