# ReactJS Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains my React learning revision and small projects as I work through various JavaScript and React concepts.

## About This Repository

This is my personal learning space where I practice and experiment with React and JavaScript concepts. The repository serves as:
- A revision hub for React fundamentals
- A collection of small projects and exercises
- A place to document my learning progress
- Practice ground for modern JavaScript and React patterns

## Current Projects

### 🎯 GuessMyNumber_Game
A number guessing game that challenges players to guess a secret number between 1 and 20:
- **Random number generation** - Computer generates a secret number each game
- **Input validation** - Ensures user inputs are within valid range (1-20)
- **Score tracking system** - Players start with 20 points, lose points for wrong guesses
- **High score persistence** - Tracks the best score across game sessions
- **Interactive feedback** - Provides hints (too high/too low) and visual feedback
- **Game reset functionality** - "Again!" button to start a new game
- **Accessibility features** - Proper labels and ARIA attributes for screen readers

**Key features:**
- Clean, intuitive user interface
- Real-time score updates
- Color-coded feedback (green for correct, red for game over)
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### 📁 MODAL_Window_Game
A JavaScript modal window implementation featuring:
- **Interactive modal windows** - Three buttons that trigger modal displays
- **DOM manipulation** - Practice with event listeners and class toggling
- **CSS styling** - Modern modal design with overlay effects
- **Responsive design** - Clean, user-friendly interface

### 🔧 Revision
A React-focused project directory containing:
- **Webpack configuration** - Modern build setup for React development
- **Package management** - Dependencies for React ecosystem
- **Development environment** - Complete setup for React learning

**Technologies used:**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- DOM manipulation techniques
- Event handling and listeners
- Math.random() for game logic
- Local storage concepts (high score tracking)

## Learning Objectives

Through this repository, I'm focusing on:
- ✅ JavaScript fundamentals and ES6+ features
- ✅ DOM manipulation and event handling
- ✅ Game logic and algorithm implementation
- ✅ User input validation and error handling
- ✅ State management in vanilla JavaScript
- ✅ Score tracking and persistence concepts
- 🔄 React component architecture (upcoming)
- 🔄 State management and hooks (upcoming)
- 🔄 Modern development workflow (upcoming)

```

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoamenNasser/ReactJS.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ReactJS/MODAL_Window_Game
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser or use a live server.

## Future Plans

As I continue my React learning journey, this repository will expand to include:
- React component-based projects
- State management examples
- Hook implementations
- API integration projects
- Advanced React patterns
- Testing implementations
